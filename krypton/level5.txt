Alright, this is a hard one.

My boy Willy Friedy invented the technique of coincidence counting, according to
Wikipedia; this is what I used to determine the size of the key.

The calculation is linked in the .cpp file, but it took me a day to wrap my head
around Index of Coincidence and how to apply it to determine the key length.

Looking at calcICFromKey, you see that I create a vector of strings of length len
long, but then I create a new string for each column and determine the I.C. from
each column string.

You can see from the ic.txt that the 9 and 18 lengths seem to be closest to the
normalized I.C. from English: 1.73. Starting with 9, I modified my found files to
work with the fa.cpp and deVig.cpp files from the last level to work with the
key KEYLENGTH, and we got the secret key!
