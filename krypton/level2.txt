Alright this one is not too difficult either. In their example, however, they
have the plain text in lower case, which is NOT what you want. You want the
end password that you get to be in all upper case (much like all of the
passwords that you have received up to this point).

I would follow all of the steps in the README file (and make sure you
understand what you are doing when you issue those commands), with the
exception of encrypting the random file that they use, make your own test file
(I used echo {A..Z} > test), where test file is then encrypted so that I can
see every single mapping for each letter.

Doing this, I see that the map is just shifted 12, so I can reverse the
process with the following command:
	cat /krypton/krypton2/krypton3 | tr 'M-ZA-L' 'A-Z'
