This one is tricky; I had to cheat and check online for hints. This problem may
look similar to natas10 because it's almost the same level, but we're going to
learn the technique that we learned in the last level to help us solve this one.

If we look at the source, we are passing one value for needle, which is going to be
checked against a dictionary. We're limited on most special characters, but we can
still inject commands. Let's try the following command and see what we get:
curl -v -u natas16:WaIHEacj63wnNIBROHeqi3p9t0m5nhmh --data-urlencode
"needle=$(echo ^hack)" natas16.natas.labs.overthewire.org.

Cool, we get all words that start with hack, but how does this help us? Well, much
like the last problem, we check if something exists. For example, if I grep for
"hackersa", I shouldn't get anything from the dictionary.

Looking at the Bash script that corresponds to this level, you'll get a better idea
of how I went about this. The first thing that we do in inject the command:
grep ^$PASSWORD$c $PASS_FILE. If this command fails, then we will just pass
"hackers" along, which we will get a match from the dictionary. If the prior grep
command works, however, our password that matches will be appended to "hackers" and
we should not expect a match from our dictionary.
