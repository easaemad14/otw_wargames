This is the exact same as the last level, with an additional "security" check to
ensure that the file is an image file.

To solve this, you'll need to understand how magic numbers work. Checking online, I
found that the JPEG magic number is ff d8 ff. Using the same file as before (make
sure you modify to print the correct password file), create a temporary hex file
with xxd: xxd -p <file.php> <file.dump>

The "-p" flag just dumps the plain hex values (no addresses, etc.). Now, all you
need to do is prepend the magic number to this file and revert with the command:
xxd -r -p <file.dump> <file.php>

You can ensure that this is now an image file by using the "file" command. Upload
your new file and you should have the password to the next level. The prepended
garbage can be ignored, this is your doing from setting the magic number.
