Alright, time to inject some SQLs.

Taking a look at the source, we have a POST method which takes a username and
password to log into a SQL database. If this is a GET request, and the request
contains "debug", they are nice enough to output our query for easy debugging.
Finally, if our query contains something, we'll be prompted with the password for
the next level.

Before we attempt something, let's try a basic GET with all inputs:
curl -v -u natas14:Lg96M10TdfaPyVBkJdjymbllQ5L6qdl1 -d "debug&username&password" -G
natas14.natas.labs.overthewire.org

Notice that I use the -G option in my cURL request to ensure that this is a GET
request, in lieu of a POST since I want to see query.

Alright, so all we need to do is force the query to be true, and we'll get all of
the resources. We can do this with the following data (remember to URL encode your
data!): -d "username=%22%20OR%201%3D1%20%2D%2D%20&password"

What the above data contains is a closing quotation mark (for the username field),
a space, the evaluation 1=1 which will always return true, and then I comment out
the rest of the line (I don't need to do this for passwords if I don't include it).
Surely there is no match for an empty username, but since this is ORed with a
statement which will always be true, the username doesn't matter. cURL the above
data and you should have your password to level15!
