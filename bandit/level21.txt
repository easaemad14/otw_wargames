Alright, some introduction to cron jobs!

What the heck is cron? To be honest, nobody really knows. I like to think that
it was named after Chronos, but there are also people that like to think that
it is an acronym (because you know how much we love them in *nix).

A quick list of the contents in the cron directory shows that there is a cron
job called cronjob_bandit22 that is doing the following: 
	* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null

The asterisks tell us that this occurs on reboot, so we know that we are good
to go since the server is up. It also tells us that bandit22 is running a
command and redirecting the stdout and stderr to /dev/null. So what's in the
shell script:
	#!/bin/bash
	chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
	cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv

Now we are getting somewhere. There is a file called
t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv that has read access by everyone, and the
contents of /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 are being put into that file. Well,
since it is the password that we are looking for, let's copy the contents of
the file and move on to the next level.
