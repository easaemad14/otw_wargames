Just a few more levels to go!

First, before we start this level, if you don't rememeber how to ssh into a
server with an rsa key, you may want to go back to the 13th level and check
that out (or just read the ssh man page).

This one is rather easy, and there are many ways to do this. My personal
preference when using diff is to use the -y (or --side-by-side) option. So my
command looked just like this: diff passwords.new passwords.old -y | grep "|".
This will have the new file on the left, and the old file on the right ('|'
would represent a change in the line, and '>' would represent an addition in
the file to the right, where '<' would represent an addition to the file on
the left in this version of diff). 

Since there was only one line that changed (and we know from the puzzle
description that this is the one that we are looking for), we now should have
the password for the next level.

We can only hope it'll be a little more difficult ;)
