Alright, so the password for the next level is stored in the data.txt file, which
contains base64 encoded data. Can you guess which command from the list you may
need in order to complete this level?

If you grew up watching Dora the Explorer, and therefore have been trained to yell
the answer outloud at a screen, then I expect that not only did you yell out base64
but also looked up the syntax for base64 on the man page, right? If you did, then
you are aware that there are only like five different options for this binary, and
the one that you want is decode: -d. So the command "base64 -d data.txt" should
give you the password for the next level!
