Last level, let's see what's in store for us before we move on!

As soon as we log into bandit25, we see that we are givin the ssh key that we
need in order to log into bandit26; there's no way that it's that eazy. The
goal warns us that bandit26 doesn't use bash as it's login shell, so before we
attempt to make connection, let's figure out what command is executed on login
with the following command: cat /etc/passwds | grep bandit26.

This shows us that bandit26 actually executes, what happens to be, a shell
script: /usr/bin/showtext. The contents of this file looks like this:
	#!/bin/sh

	more ~/text.txt
	exit 0

This seems a bit odd, and bandit25 does not have read access to this file, so
it looks like we have to ssh into bandit26 to see what is actually going on. 

Once we do so, we see that text.txt in bandit26's home directory is an ASCII
art of itself:
	  _                     _ _ _   ___   __  
	 | |                   | (_) | |__ \ / /  
	 | |__   __ _ _ __   __| |_| |_   ) / /_  
	 | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __| / / '_ \ 
	 | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ / /| (_) |
	 |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|____\___/ 
	Connection to bandit.labs.overthewire.org closed.

This is a bit cheeky; how do we get around this? Well the 'more' command will
actually only output as much as it can on the screen, so we need to trick it
from thinking that it's done by making our window less than six lines long (if
I counted correctly). 

But that doesn't exactly solve our problem, because we still need to be able
to read the password that is stored in the /etc/bandit_pass directory. A quick
read of more's man page (I actually don't use it regularly) tells us that we
can start up a visual editor with the 'v' key.

The current visual editor that is set by default is vim, so now you have full
access to vim commands, such as the 'set' command, which is the one that I
used to change the shell to bash (:set shell=bash). This allows you to now
type the command ':shell', which will now jump into a brand new bash session,
where you can read the current password, and the README file under the home
directory which congratulates you on completing all of the currect levels (if
you happen to complete these before they come up with more for bandit).

Next, I will tackle the Krypton levels, and work my way on from there.
