So now you see that ~/inhere is a directory, and you tried to ls the contents and
didn't see anything. This is because there is a hidden file (starts with a '.' in

(-a) to see everything. 

If this is new to you, you will become familiar with these pretty quickly if you
start messing with configuration files and such.
