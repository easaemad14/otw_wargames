Alright, so we are still learning some basic UNIX/LINUX commands. For this level,
you will find the file "~/data.txt", which has quite a few lines of text with each
line containing an English word followed by a possible password for the next level.

The easiest way to do this is to use the "grep" command (you will probably become
very familiar with this command). Using the following command will give you the
output that you are looking for:
	bandit7@melinda:~$ grep millionth data.txt 
	millionth       cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV

"millionth" is the keyword that you are looking for, and data.txt (assuming you are
in the directory containing the file) is the file you want to look through. The 
second line outputs the contents of the line with the matching pattern. 

And there you go; you now have the password for the next level so let's keep on
going!
