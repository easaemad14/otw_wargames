Another level that isn't very difficult, but this concept is VERY important!

I did a quick ls of /etc/bandit_pass to see the files, and found the file that
we need to read. Then, all we have to do is type the following command, which
will allow you to read this file that is owned (and only readable) by
bandit20: ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20

Let's move on, shall we?
