Alright, let's learn the new command "tr" and have some fun with cryptography in the
most basic use of the concept: rotations.

The file contains the message "The password is ...", but this string has been trans-
formed (or rotated) from the standard mapping (a-z) to the new mapping 13 characters
down the line (n-za-m). What this means is if you have the letter 'a', it becomes the
letter 'n' after the transform, the letter 'b' becomes 'o', and the letter 'n'
becomes 'a', this is why they call it a rotation because you can picture the letters
in a circular manner.

tr is the new command which will make this easy for us. Using the following command
should get you the right output: 
	cat data.txt | tr 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' 'A-Za-z'

What this does is reads the contents of data (if you forgot cat, you might want to
look it up because you will use this a lot when accessing files), and pipes the out-
put to tr, which takes all of the 52 characters 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' and translates them
into the 52 characters 'A-Za-z'.

Now that you have the password for the next level, let's keep moving since these are
starting to get interesting!
