Just moved to Oregon a few days ago, so I have a little time on my hands at
the moment. I am continuing where we left off, and this one is pretty straight
forward.

In this challenge, you will need to connect to the bandit server (I couldn't
remember the hostname because it's been so long since I have done any of
these, so I had to look it up) and send the password (the same one that you
used to log in) to the localhost port 30000. 

In order to solve this one, I used telnet in order to connect to the port with
the following command: bandit14@melinda:~$ telnet localhost 30000

You should see the following out put if you typed this correctly:
	Trying 127.0.0.1...
	Connected to localhost.
	Escape character is '^]'.

If you see this, a successful connection has been made, and you should just be
able to submit the password and hit enter.

But what the shit does '^]' mean? Well, according to our old friend tldp.org
(we referenced this website a while ago when trying to figure out why the
command "cat" didn't work when trying to output our file '-'), the caret (^)
"matches the beginning of a line, but sometimes, depending on context, negates
the meaning of a set of characters in an RE", and brackets '[' and ']'
"enclose a set of characters to match in a single RE." So putting the two of
these together, we can see that '^]' is a fancy way of saying that we go to
the next line, ending our regular expression. Or, I have no clue what I am
talking about and all of that last paragraph was wrong. Either way, you
learned something?

Now, after submitting the password, you should see the following output:
	Correct!
	BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr

	Connection closed by foreign host.

Now, let's do some work with SSL encryptions!
