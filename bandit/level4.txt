Alright, more fun Linux commands. Just like the last one, there is a "inhere"
directory, but this time there are a number of files (looks like a total of 10 to
me), and the one we are looking for is the "only human readible one", which I took
as a challenge :)

When we look at the files in the "inhere" directory, you should see something like:
-rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 Nov 14 10:32 -file00
-rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 Nov 14 10:32 -file01
-rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 Nov 14 10:32 -file02
-rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 Nov 14 10:32 -file03
-rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 Nov 14 10:32 -file04
-rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 Nov 14 10:32 -file05
-rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 Nov 14 10:32 -file06
-rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 Nov 14 10:32 -file07
-rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 Nov 14 10:32 -file08
-rw-r----- 1 bandit5 bandit4   33 Nov 14 10:32 -file09
drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root    4096 Nov 14 10:32 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root    root    4096 Nov 14 10:32 ..

Now, in order to find the FILE type that is readible by us humans, we use the
"file" command (if I haven't stressed this enough, man pages are your friend). My
input and the corresponding output was as follows:
bandit4@melinda:~/inhere$ file ./-*
./-file00: data
./-file01: data
./-file02: data
./-file03: data
./-file04: data
./-file05: data
./-file06: data
./-file07: ASCII text
./-file08: data
./-file09: data

What this is doing is recursively determining the file type of each file (if we had
a directory with more files in this directory, it would keep walking through those
as well) in this directory. If you remember from a couple levels back, the '-' char
is usually evaluated as an option, so you you didn't include the './', the file
command would think that you were trying to use the '-f' option. 

The '*' is a wildcard, which basically says that any combination of characters and
letters that follow a dash (since this was the first char in our path) should be 
included. You could also do something like "file ./-file0?", which would do the
same thing, but I'm too lazy to write the extra four characters, and there was no
need to be more specific since we wanted to check all of the files in this 
directory. 

So, from the output, you see that "-file07" is the file that you want, so you read
the content and are ready for the next level, right? Okay, awesome; let's keep
going!
