Now, let's try something with networking and setuid!

For this level, we need to use netcat in listen mode in order to get a message
back (the password for the next level) from a port or our choosing. Because we
have the ability to choose any port that we want, let's make sure that the
port we choose isn't already in use: nmap -p1000-2000 localhost.

This listed all (two) of the ports that were in use between 1000 and 2000, so
I can go ahead and pick any port that I want that isn't 1111 or 1840. This is
what my netcat command looked like:
	echo GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j | netcat localhost 1234 -l

I bet you thought I was going to use port 1337, right? I wanted to leave it
open for all of the s|<rIpt kIddi3s ;)

Alright, now that we sent our current password to port number 1234, we just
need to connect our setuid bin to that port, and we should be good to go:

need to connect our setuid bin to that port, and we should be good to go:
	./suconnect 1234 
	Read: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
	Password matches, sending next password

Now that we know that we sent the correct password, you can go back to the
session that is running your listening netcat and you should have the password
printed to stdout and ready to go!
