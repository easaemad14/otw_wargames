This is another level with some cronjob task, but there is much more to this
than simply following files around. 

First thing, we need to check the cronjob, and what it's doing:
	* * * * * bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null

So far this looks like what we did in the last level, so let's check the shell
script that is being executed on reboot:
	#!/bin/bash

	myname=$(whoami)
	mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

	echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

	cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget

Alright, so we are executing this shell script which creates a variable called
"myname", which is the name associated with the effective user id, and another
variable that contains something a little more complicated. Looks like we are
piping the string "I am user $myname" into a program called md5sum, and then
cutting the string at the first space (' ') and storing the first field into
our variable called "mytarget". Finally, it prints a message to let you know
what it is doing, and then puts the password of the name into a file called
/tmp/$mytarget.

Easy enough, right? Now all we need to do is get the password for bandit23, so
running the following command should give us the file name that contains our
password: 
	echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1

This will output our file name to stdout, and all we need to do is read that
file that is stored under the tmp directory.
