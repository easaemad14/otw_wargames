Okay, so this is going to be a short one since this is a very short level.

This may seem trivial at first, but you are supposed to learn about one of linux's
special characters: '-'. The dash is recognized by an option by several utilities
to either represent stdin or stdout. This may seem trivial, but this does have some
use in the real world. For example, if I want to pass input from the command line,
and I don't want the new line character to be included when I hit the enter (or
return) button.

Okay, so how do you read the file. Use the "./" to specify the current file you are
in and the file (so "./-") and you should be reading the password for the next level.

Alright, let's keep moving on!
