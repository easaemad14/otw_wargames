Alright, so let's take a look at a new (probably one of the most widely used) UNIX
command: strings. 

The strings command (by default) will print out a series of printable characters
that are at least 4 characters long. This file was not too long, so you could
probably have just opened it with your favorite text editor (VIM), and searched for
a few '=' characters, but the point of these are to learn new commands. 

Using our new command strings, and prior knowledge of pipes, the following command
should give you the line (I chose the one with the password that looked most like
other passwords that we have used thus far) containing the password for the next
level: 
	strings data.txt | grep ===

The goal stated that the line began with "several '=' characters", so piping the
output to the grep command (searching for a few '=' characters) should give you the
lines that contain at least three '=' characters.
