Okay, welcome to the Bandit directory. I will begin with this one, even though I 
expect this to be under my current level. With that being said, I am sure there is
something for me to learn, and I will do my best to be as thorough in my write-ups.

Please let me know if there is anything that miss or if any errors are made, and I
will correct as soon as possible. I appreciate all feedback, since this is not only
a spot for me to show what I am capable of (as far as learning is concerned), but
also a learning process, since this is exactly what these are designed for.
