What you should learn doing this exercise is VERY IMPORTANT, so make sure you under-
stand the concept.

Most of the time, you will need to combine tools that you have at your disposal in
such a way to complete a task. In this exercise specifically, we need to SORT the
lines of the ~/data.txt in such as way that we only want to output the UNIQUE lines
contained in the file. Based off of the words in the last sentence that were
emphasized, you may be understanding what commands you will need in order to obtain
the next password: sort and uniq.

Okay, so how do we combine commands in such a way that the output of one command is
used as the input of another command? This is the important concept of this level,
and the answer (in case you didn't read the "Helpful Reading Material" section) lies
in pipes (|). Let's try and understand the following command in great detail: 
	sort data.txt | uniq -u

By default, sort does not have an option for output and prints the output to stdout.
Using piping (you may remember me using this in a prior level to pipe the output of
a command to the "less" binary) will redirect the output to something else, and in
this case that something else is the uniq command (as input). The '-u' option tells
uniq to only print the lines that are unique (uniq isn't specific to just unique
lines; it has other similar functionalities). Notice that we are not specifying an
output file (uniq's syntax asks for an input followed by an output), therefore uniq
prints to stdout. 

Alright, we are about a third of the way there, so let's keep on keeping on!
