This one is not too difficult. As soon as we log in, the .bashrc file echos
"ByeBye !" and exits, so we have no way to read what is in the file "readme"
(or do we?). 

Well of course we do; there is always a way! You may have noticed (or maybe
you're reading this because you didn't) that the ssh command gives you the
ability to execute a command on the remote host, in lieu of a login shell.
Therefore, since we know the file that has the contents in it, we can simpy
type: ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org cat readme

What if we didn't know the exact file we wanted to read, how would we do this?
Well, instead of letting the bashrc file run when we log in, why not just pass
a shell command to start immediatly? When I issued the command "ls -al /bin/ |
grep sh", it looks like we can either start bash or dash (rbash is symlinked
to bash and sh is symlinked to dash). So you could easily replace the cat
command with something a little more useful if they didn't make it so easy,
but maybe that'll come up in the future.
