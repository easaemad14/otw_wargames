Alright, so I don't need to do a write up for this one because it was just like the
last level and you have already completed it, right? Since I already starting
typing, I will go ahead and do it anyway ;)

So this problem is almost identical to the last, with the exception that now we
have to find the directory (it isn't just sitting in $HOME for us). So we know it's
somewhere on the server (Linux file hierarchy is simple, and if you are not yet
familiar with it, I would suggest a quick read of why it is so wonderful), and we
also know the owner (or user), the group (or group user), and the exact size. With
all of this, we use the following command, and what do we see?
	find -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c | less

I went ahead and piped (|) this to less, so that I could scroll through the output
expecting that it wasn't just going to be one file this time. Luckily, it was still
only one file, but there was some new output that we have yet to see. The page 
should have filled up with a bunch of error messages stating that the permission
was denied. This is due to you not having read writes. To demonstrate, you will
notice the line /var/tmp has the permission denied error, so let's take a look at
that directory. Using the command "ls -al /var", I see the complete list of all (a)
files in the directory in long (l) format. Here's the line containing the tmp
directory:
	drwxrwx-wt 27 root     root     36864 Mar  3 02:12 tmp

You'll notice that root is the owner and the group user, and that for all other
users there is a dash in place of the 'r'. This is what we expected from the error
message!

Now, if we scroll up on the output to less, we see that there is only one file, and
reading that file will give you the correct password for the next level! Alright, I
know you are starting to have some fun, so let's keep working through these!
