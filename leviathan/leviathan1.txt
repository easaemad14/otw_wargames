For this level, we have a setuid ELF in our home directory, which looks like it
give us some level two permissions if we get the password correct.

Running the strings command, are are two strings that catch my eye: "love" and
"getchar".

Since "love" was the first string to catch my eye, I tried this password: nope!
"getchar" is interesting, because this tells me that they are reading characters
one at a time from stdin. Let's try to just enter no password, i.e. just hit
return without any input.

Hey, look at that! Whoever wrote this is expecting some number of characters and
reads characters until length, in lieu of reading the whole line or breaking after
the first character that doesn't match what's expected!

Simply hitting enter three times tells me that the password is three characters
long, hence why strings didn't show me the password: strings defaults to four
characters.

Now, let's show all strings of minimum length three: strings -n 3 check. We have a
couple more English words now: sex and god....
