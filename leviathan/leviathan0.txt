Starting off leviathan, it looks like all of our work will be done in the home
directory. Doing an ls of our home directory shows nothing....

Hidden files in *nix land are preceeded with the '.' character. These are "hidden"
because they are not usually shown. To see all, we can use the 'a' (to see "all")
or the 'A' (to see all minus '.' and '..', current and parent directories,
respectively) flags.

"ls -Al" shows that there is a hidden directory called "backup", which contains an
HTML document called bookmarks. Searching this file for anything "leviathan"
related shows a password....
