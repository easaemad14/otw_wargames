This is the root directory for the OverTheWire Wargames that I will begin going through.

I will be going though these wargames in the order that they suggest, starting from the
easiest (Bandit), and my goal is to work all the way through all of the wargames hosted
on this site. Some of this may be too easy for me to be starting, but I am sure that
there is plenty for me to learn, and I will do my best to be as thorough in my write-ups
as possible in hopes that I will learn something that I may have glossed over in my
attempt to learn as much as possible in such a short amount of time.

If there is anything that I miss in my write-ups, of if you find anything that isn't
correct, please let me know and I will correct as soon as possible.
